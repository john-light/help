<h4 id="balances"><a href="#balances">2. Balances</a></h4>
<p>
	<img src="img/dashboard-balances.png">
</p>
<p>
	The first section you will see at the top of the Dashboard contains your ANJ balance information. This section is divided in three columns: <strong>My wallet</strong>, <strong>Inactive</strong> and <strong>Active</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>My wallet</strong> shows the amount of ANJ that your Ethereum wallet currently contains and its relative value in US dollars. Those tokens are not being managed by the Court and are at any given time fully under your control. To activate them and increase your chances of being drafted as a juror, you can click the <strong>Activate</strong> button at the bottom of the section and a side panel will appear asking for the amount of ANJ that you want to activate. The amount will be transfered to the <strong>Active</strong> section once the transaction is executed.
	<br />
	If you don't own any ANJ tokens, you can click the <strong>Buy ANJ</strong> button at the top right of the dashboard. <a href="">Click here</a> to learn more about the various ways to obtain ANJ.
</p>
<p>
	The second column contains your inactive ANJ balance along with its value in US dollars. Inactive ANJ is held in the Court contract but doesn't increase your probability of being drafted. Two actions are available when you have an inactive balance: 
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Withdraw: </strong>Will withdraw a portion of the inactive ANJ to your wallet.</li>
		<li><strong>Activate: </strong>Will activate a portion of the inactive ANJ and transfer it to the <strong>Active</strong> section.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The third column contains your active ANJ tokens. Active tokens serves three main purposes:
	<ul>
		<li>They determine your probability of being drafted as a juror. The higher the amount, the higher the probability.</li>
		<li>Subscription rewards are directly proportional to active tokens. <a href="#rewards">Click here</a> to learn more about the different types of rewards.</li>
		<li>In order to incentivize consensus decisions and honest behaviors, a portion of your active ANJ is staked when drafted for a dispute and you can get rewarded or penalized depending on the final ruling. <a href="disputes.html">Click here</a> to learn more about disputes.</li>
	</ul>
	The <strong>Deactivate</strong> button can be used to transfer ANJ tokens to an inactive state.
</p>

<p>Each column contains its own history of recent transactions.</p>

<p>Finally, at the top of the section, you can see in real-time your probabilty being drafted as a juror. This probability takes into account the number of disputes and their current state.</p>
